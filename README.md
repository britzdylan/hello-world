# hello-world
My First Repository

Hi I’m Dylan,

I help innovative organizations to build digital experiences by delivering strategic solutions that brings ideas to life & connects you with the right audience.

I am a self-taught website designer,  Identity designer, front-end developer & father. I am not talented. Just passionately curious. I play way too much video games & love to workout. I believe knowledge is power & I always try and learn something new, whether its for my work or life. My dream is to impact as many people as i can in my lifetime, through design, charity or just a simple hello.

I set on a mission to use my experience, mistakes I’ve made & lessons I’ve learned to help more businesses use the power of the digital world to grow their brand, through creating unique & memorable user experiences & beautiful user-friendly interfaces. I set a goal to learn, create & share!
